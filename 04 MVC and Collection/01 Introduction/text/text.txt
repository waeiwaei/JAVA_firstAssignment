The next two workbooks will lead you through an assessed exercise that has a weighting of 20%
(i.e. it WILL contribute to your unit mark).
The focus of this assignment is to build an interactive graphical game.
The assignment will be marked on the lab machines, so it is essential that you check that you
can compile and run your code using Maven on a lab machine before submission.

You are encouraged to discuss assignments and possible solutions with other students.
HOWEVER it is essential that you only submit your own work.

This may feel like a grey area, however if you adhere to the following advice, you should be fine:

- Never exchange code with other students (via IM/email, GIT, forums, printouts, photos or any other means)
- Although pair programming is encouraged in some circumstances, on this unit you must type your own work !
- It's OK to seek help from online sources (e.g. Stack Overflow) but don't just cut-and-paste chunks of code...
- If you don't understand what a line of code actually does, you shouldn't be submitting it !
- Don't submit anything you couldn't re-implement under exam conditions (with a good textbook !)

If you ask a question on a discussion forum, try to keep discussion at a high level
(i.e. not pasting in chunks of your code). If it is unavoidable to include code, only share
small snippets of the essential sections you need assistance with.

An automated checker will be used to flag any incidences of possible plagiarism in submitted code.
If the markers feel that intentional plagiarism has actually taken place, marks may be deducted.
In serious or extensive cases, the incident may be reported to the faculty plagiarism panel.
This may result in a mark of zero for the assignment, or perhaps even the entire unit
(if it is a repeat offence).
Don't panic - if you stick to the above list of advice, you should remain safe !
