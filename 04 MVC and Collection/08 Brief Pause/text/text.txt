When you get to this point in the workbook, you should have implemented all of the core features of the OXO game.
This is not the end of the exercise however - in the next workbook you will get to implement an error handling mechanism
as well as a number of extensions to the basic game. It is worth pausing for a moment to see how far you have come.
Take a look at your code to see if there is anything that could be refactored to improve structure and readability.
You should be making backups of your work regularly - if you haven't done so recently, now is a good time.
Maybe also time for a couple of games of OXO before moving on !
