When viewing the example test script, you may have noticed a new test feature not previously encountered - the `@BeforeEach` annotation
is used to mark a method which will be executed _before_ any `@Test` methods are run.
This allows us to create a "setup" method that will initialise any instances that are required to successfully run a `@Test` method.
You will also see the use of the `()->` "lambda" expression. Don't worry about this for the moment, we will consider it in more detail in the next workbook.
