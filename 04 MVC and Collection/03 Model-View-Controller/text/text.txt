The Model-View-Controller (MVC) "pattern" is a common structural convention that is used widely in the development of
interactive systems. To help get you started in this assignment, you have been provided with a <a href="cw-oxo/" target="_blank">Maven template</a>
that conforms to the Model-View-Controller pattern. Copy this project to your development folder - don't work on it in-situ, it might get overwritten
by future GitHub pull commands.

Take a look at the slides and video above for an introduction to the concept of the Model-View-Controller pattern,
then use the knowledge gained to explore the OXO game template.

The `OXOModel` class contains all of the core data structures required by the game - you can use the public methods
provided by this class in order to manipulate the following internal state:

- The number of cells in a row required to win the game (3 in a standard game)
- The set of players currently playing the game (2 in a standard game !)
- The player whose turn it currently is
- The "owner" (player who has claimed) each cell in the game grid
- The winner of the game (when the game ends)
- Whether or not the game has been drawn (all cells filled, but with no winner !)

The "Rendering Logic" has already been implemented for you: any changes to the state of the `OXOModel`
will be automatically rendered by the `OXOView`. 
Your main task is to implement the "Event Handling Logic" in the `OXOCOntroller` class.
Your code will need to manipulate the state of the `OXOModel` by calling appropriate methods on it.
You will however NOT need to interface directly with the `OXOView` class.

You may alter and add to the `OXOController` and `OXOModel` classes, however 
you should NOT change the signatures of any of the _existing_ methods
(if you change the method names or parameters, you may break the marking scripts used to assess your work after submission !)
You should NOT alter the `OXOView` or `OXOGame` classes at all.
The remaining tasks in this week's (and next week's) workbooks will lead you through the features that you need to implement to complete the assignment.

Finally, it is very important to remember that the `OXOModel` class should be used to maintain ALL game state.
You should definitely NOT be storing any game state in your `OXOController` class - bad things will happen if you do !
