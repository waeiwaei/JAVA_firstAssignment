Your aim in this assignment is to build a digital version of the classic turn-taking game
"Noughts and Crosses" / "Tic-Tac-Toe" / "OXO". You will NOT however be required to construct the _entire_ game.
The Graphical User Interface (see screenshot below) and the core Data Model classes will be provided for you.
You will however be required to write the "Controller" that handles all of the game logic.
