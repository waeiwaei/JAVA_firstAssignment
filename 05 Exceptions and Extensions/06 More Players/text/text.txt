Although two players in the traditional number in an OXO game, allowing additional players would make for a more interesting game.
As an extension to the standard game, add features to your code so that it can support any number of players.
To achieve this you will need to make changes to both the `OXOModel` as well as your `OXOController`.
You will need to use alternative player characters for the additional players - having more than one player who's letter is X
will lead to a lot of confusion !

You should NOT attempt to alter the `OXOView` or `OXOGame` to allow the _interactive_ setting of the number of players.
Instead, you should focus on testing multi-player games by creating additional test cases in your testing script.

Remember to try to ensure that your code is flexible versatile (don't hard-wire in any fixed values) !
