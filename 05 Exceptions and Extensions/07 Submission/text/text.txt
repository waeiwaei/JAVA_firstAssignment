Remember that this assignment WILL be assessed and the mark will count towards your grade for this unit.
In order to submit your code, go to "Assessment, submission and feedback" section on Blackboard page for this unit.
It is **ESSENTIAL** that you make sure your code compiles and runs using the `mvnw` command before you submit it
(otherwise we will not be able to run it to mark it !).

Make sure that your code does not contain anything specific to your computer (e.g. absolute file paths, operating system specific code etc).
Before submitting your code, we advise your to test your project on a computer _other than the one it was developed on_ (e.g. a lab machine).
Clear out all temporary files and then ensure the code compiles and runs correctly using Maven. We will apply a penalty mark if we cannot run your code
"out of the box" - we can't spend time fixing everyones projects before we mark them !

It is VERY important that you do NOT change the name or parameters of any of the classes and methods that you have been given.
Scripts will be used to automatically run your code to make sure it operates correctly -
if you change them, we won't be able to mark your code !
It is **ESSENTIAL** that you check your code still passes the original skeleton test script - if this does not pass these basic tests
then it is likely your code not not pass any of the other test scripts.

Remember to include your entire project structure when you submit your code, with all the files and folder
(including both your `main` source folder as well as the `test` folder containing your test scripts)

Note that you should not have made any permanent changes to the `OXOView`, `OXOGame` or `OXOPlayer` classes.
These will get replaced during the marking process, so you shouldn't be relying on any code
that you have added to them !
